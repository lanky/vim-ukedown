# vim-ukedown

Syntax and filetype plugins (etc) for the `ukedown` songsheet markup syntax. Tested with neovim and vim 8+

## Current features
autodetect of filetype for '*.udn' files
highlighting of section headers, chords, boxouts, backing vox and performance notes



## Missing features...

* inherit from markdown too, as ukedown is a special case of this
* need to override tables here as we use those for boxouts
